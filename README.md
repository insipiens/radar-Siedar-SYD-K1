the device can be driven via a basic 12 volt supply. the A+,B- and ground connected to a MAX13487 chip based converter. This avoids the issue of switching from input to output required normally with MAX 485 chips. The converter can be bought cheaply on Amazon or AliExpress etc.

If you do not have a 12v supply then using an ESP32 chip connected to a 2.4A AC/DC usb supply can also supply the required power with a 5v > 12v buck boost (I have this currently over a 25m connection).
